## Mortality Prediction: A Na√Øve Bayes Classification Approach

Accurate prediction of mortality is of great importance in _public health research_, enabling proactive healthcare planning, resource allocation, and policy development. **Mortality prediction** models that incorporate relevant predictors can assist healthcare providers and policymakers in identifying high-risk populations, implementing targeted interventions, and improving overall healthcare outcomes. While several approaches have been explored in mortality prediction, the integration of health indicators and socioeconomic factors has shown promise in capturing the complex relationship between individual health characteristics and mortality risk.  
This research aims to develop a _mortality prediction model_ using a **Gaussian Naive Bayes classification** approach that incorporates various health indicators. **Naive Bayes** is a well-established and computationally efficient classification algorithm that assumes independence between predictors, Gaussian Naive Bayes also assumes the features distributions are Gaussian.

Our research is divided into the following sections:
